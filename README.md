# Raycaster engine I made in GCC
# You can mess with some of the macros but I've already tried them out and found the current ones comfortable
# To build, you have to clone SDL's SDL2 branch into 'external' as 'SDL2'; you can use:
# `git clone --branch SDL2 https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git`
# Uses method getline (POSIX specific)
# You can edit map.txt; 1 is a wall, 0 is none for the raycaster
